# UFOs

## Project Overview
Using JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, a website containing an interactive table was created to organize data pertaining to UFO sightings across North America. The data was taken from a JavaScript array and put into a dynamic table that allows the user to filter through multiple criteria.

The image above shows the main page on which the table is displayed, without any filters applied. The following image shows the results of a filtered search to show only triangle UFO shapes observed in the city of El Cajon. As shown in the highlighted filter dashboard, the user can search by date, city, state, country and/or shape. In order to reset the search criteria, the user must click on the "UFO Sightings" text at the top of the page.
