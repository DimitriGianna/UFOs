# UFOs

## Project Overview
In this project, data obtained from a JavaScript array was taken and used to create an interactive table where the user can filter through multiple criteria to obtain information about UFO sightings. This table was created using Javascript, with modifactions being made through CSS and Bootstrap to enhance the appearance of the webpage.

## Results



## Summary
Despite its usefulness, the webpage has a few drawbacks. One major drawback is the fact that the user must enter a specific date which would make it difficult for them to narrow down a search.

Improvements the webpage might include:

- A date range filter so that the user does not have to enter a specific date which would also allow them to see the frequency of sightings over a particular time period.
- Having the search fields allow for both upper and lowercase letters.
